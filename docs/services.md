    excerpt: '<p>The European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive mandates that over 50.000 EU and some non-EU companies disclose their sustainability information as a part of their annual management report.</p>
    <p>The start of the CSRD disclosures is based on company size, turnover, listed status and geographical market, with first enterprises being required to report in 2025 for financial year 2024. The reporting requirements are extensive and cover many areas of sustainability based on the double materiality principle, which can be particularly challenging for companies who are only starting to define their sustainability strategy.</p>
    <p><strong>Some of our deliverables are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Trainings (Introduction to CSRD)</li>
    <li>Roadmap to the CSRD (analysis of the current state and required future steps for corporate sustainability reporting)</li>
    <li>Materiality assessment with the double materiality perspective</li>
    <li>CSRD and ESRS gap analysis</li>
    <li>CSRD project management for implementation projects</li>

    excerpt: '<p>Are you developing a new product and need a <strong>Life Cycle Assessment</strong> (LCA) and <strong>Environmental Product Declaration</strong> (EPD)?</p>
      <p>We conduct LCA for construction projects and materials using <a href="https://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/hallbart-byggande-och-forvaltning/livscykelanalys/miljodata-och-lca-verktyg/verktyg-for-lca/">Boverket</a> approved software. Our LCA helps you understand the environmental impact of your building design and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
      <p>An EPD describes the product’s environmental impact in a transparent and comparable manner and is based on the LCA. Depending on what the product is, product category rules (PCR) define what needs to be included in the report.</p>
      <p>For example, an EPD for construction products needs to include 19 different environmental impact categories across the product’s manufacturing and end of life stages, which helps you identify potential environmental issues along the value chain to implement more circular designs for improved environmental performance.</p>'

# Sustainability Profiling for Products

A sustainable business is about creating positive environmental, economic, and social impact.

With material circularity playing a crucial role in sustainability reporting, product certification, and regulatory compliance across various sectors, we think that knowing your environmental footprint is key for success. LCA is one of the most effective tools to measure and describe the environmental impact of products and find practical ways to improve these.

We offer our clients LCA, EPD, and in-depth education in those tools. In addition we provide technology advice and strategic support to build circular businesses.
