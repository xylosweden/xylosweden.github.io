In February 2024, ISO issued a climate-related amendment to 31 existing management system standards. ðŸ”Ž

![](/assets/images/iso14001-300x240.jpg){: .text-center}

This includes popular management systems such as [ISO 14001](https://www.iso.org/standard/88209.html) (environmental management system) and [ISO 9001](https://www.iso.org/standard/88431.html) (quality management system) and many others. ðŸ“š

To honour ISOâ€™s commitment to the Paris agreement, the amendment requires the organisations to assess the materiality of climate change for their business operations.

What does this mean for companies with implemented management systems affected by the amendment?

ðŸ§© Climate considerations must be included as an important factor affecting business (for example, related to existing or upcoming climate legislation, changes in preferences affecting demand, supply chain disruptions).

ðŸ§©Climate change-related requirements can be included in individual management systems (such as calculations of organisationâ€™s carbon footprint). 

ðŸ§©Further push in the direction of contemporary sustainability reporting â€“ identification of risks and opportunities related to climate.
