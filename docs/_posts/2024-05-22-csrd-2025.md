As the first companies are releasing their sustainability statements ahead of the reporting season in 2025, the discussion about the potential benefits of the [CSRD](/introduction-to-csrd/) is alive and relevant.

What can individual companies gain?

🎯 Improved overview of their value chain  
🎯 Directive-supported leverage for obtaining information from their suppliers/distributors  
🎯 Consolidated report that showcases sustainability efforts to investors, customers and partners  
🎯 Increased connectivity of corporate departments and management  
🎯 Competitive edge against their competitors (if they truly show better sustainability performance!)  
🎯 Company attractiveness to new talent  
🎯 Clear year-on-year sustainability improvement strategy

What can the sustainability reporting landscape gain?

🎯 Standardised and comparable reports across different industries and countries  
🎯 Clear signal that sustainability issues can no longer be ignored (penalties for non-compliant companies!)  
🎯 Less greenwashing, more substance (the importance of third-party auditing)  
🎯 Momentum to build on the CSRD (evaluate, improve, repeat; synergies with other legislation)  
🎯 Call to action – CSRD reporting as a catalyst for reducing negative socio-environmental impacts

Despite the initial effort needed for companies to meet the requirements of the CSRD, we at Xylo Sweden AB firmly believe that your work will pay off. Plus, you do not have to do it alone!
