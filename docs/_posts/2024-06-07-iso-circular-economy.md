The new ISO - International Organization for Standardization standards on Circular Economy have been published! üëèüéà

The new family of standards brings the much-expected formalised frameworks on circular economy (CE)‚ôªÔ∏è and will help organisations in assessing, measuring, communicating, and implementing CE principles in their business models. üí°

New ISO family of standards on circular economy (ISO 59000)

* ISO 59004: CE - Vocabulary, principles and guidance for implementation
* ISO 59010: CE - Guidance on the transition of business models and value networks
* ISO 59020: CE - Measuring and assessing circularity performance
* ISO 59040: CE - Product circularity data sheet (under development)
* ISO 59014: Env. mgmt. and CE - Sustainability and traceability of the recovery of secondary materials - Principles and requirements (under development)

Just to start off, here is the definition of the circular economy (From ISO 59004:2024): 
*"economic system (3.1.2) that uses a systemic approach to maintain a circular flow of resources (3.1.6), by recovering, retaining or adding to their value (3.1.7), while contributing to sustainable development (3.1.11)*

Note 1 to entry: Resources  (3.1.5) can be considered concerning both stocks and flows.

Note 2 to entry: The inflow of virgin resources (3.3.2) is kept as low as possible, and the circular flow of resources is kept as closed as possible to minimize waste (3.3.6), losses (3.3.7) and releases (3.3.8) from the economic system."

üí¨ What are your thoughts on the new standards and what role could they play in your organisation? 

üìÆ Let's talk circularity!
