Have you developed a new product or material and need to show how sustainable it is? Maybe a potential custumer is asking you to get the GWP of your product? Whatever the case, the GWP of your product can open many doors for you in the green economy.

# Here is what it is and how you get one. ðŸ‘‰  

Global Warming Potential (GWP) is one of the many environmental impact indicatorsðŸ“‹ you can choose from when doing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to measure the environmental impact of your products! ðŸŒ±   
   
GWP is an indicator used to communicate the productâ€™s potential contribution to climate change. More specifically, it describes the generated amount of greenhouse gas emissions across a productâ€™s life cycle.   
   
It is expressed as kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (kgCO2e), which means that the global warming potential of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide (methane, nitrous oxides, hydrofluorocarbons and so on) is â€˜translatedâ€™ into a singular score. This makes it easy to report and a popular parameter to communicate with your audience. ðŸ“¢  
   
For instance, if mitigating climate change is one of the focal points of your company and its products, then the GWP metric can help you showcase its climate-friendliness and provide a point of comparison with alternative products.   
   
But thatâ€™s just the tip of the icebergâ€”other categories like eutrophication, depletion of abiotic resources and more offer a holistic perspective on environmental effects.   
   
Making informed decisions helps us move towards a greener economy. ðŸŒŽ
