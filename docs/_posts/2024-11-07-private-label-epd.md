We recently completed an Environmental Product Declaration for one of our clients, and now their customers are taking the initiative to develop private label EPDs for the products they purchase. This means they can accurately track and disclose their own brand’s environmental impact, including logistics and CO2 emissions from transporting the products to their respective markets.

🔍 Here’s what we’ve learned from similar cases:

✅ Both original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and private label brands can develop their own EPDs, even using the same LCA consultant and verifier.

✅ If there’s a time gap between the OEM and the private label EPD creation, the LCA report will need to be updated and verified to reflect any changes, such as country-specific factors and additional emissions.

✅ By creating private label EPDs, brands ensure they meet local sustainability standards, remain transparent, and demonstrate true environmental commitment to their customers.
