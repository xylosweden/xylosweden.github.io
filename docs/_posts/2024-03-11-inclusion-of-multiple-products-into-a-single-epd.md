Did you know ‚ÅâÔ∏è

**Several products can be covered by a single EPD!**

The programme operator‚Äôs GPI (General Programme Instructions) and individual PCRs (Product Category Rules) outline in which situations multiple products can be grouped and published as a single Environmental Product Declaration. üí≠

This usually depends on whether the products are similar enough, manufactured at the same site, and the variability of the LCA results (often, 10 % variation in the results of environmental impact categories is allowed).

In the case of the PCR for Construction products from EPD International, a large and popular category for EPDs, the grouping can be based on:

- reporting the **averaged results** for each indicator based on production volumes (the LCA is performed for each included product and then the values are reported as the average based on the production fraction of each individual product)
- choosing a **‚Äòrepresentative product‚Äô** and reporting those results (the choice of the representative product needs to be justified and supported by data)
- declaring the results for the **worst-case performing products**

This is useful primarily because it is cost efficient! üí∞

- Since EPDs need to be verified by a third independent party and published through a programme operator, this saves you consulting hours and administrative costs.

- Especially if you are an SME producing similar products (e.g., doors of different dimensions but roughly same materials and manufacturing processes), this can be a great opportunity for showcasing your sustainability efforts through a single EPD.

- Additionally, it can ease the data collection process if data for multiple products is collected at once, especially if all the products manufactured at one facility can be grouped into one (or two) EPDs. This saves time both for you and for us, win-win! üèÖ
