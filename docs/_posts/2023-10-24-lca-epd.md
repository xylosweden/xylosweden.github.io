Are you overwhelmed with all the sustainability regulations?

At Xylo Sweden AB we believe Sustainability Compliance shouldn’t be so complicated. We are here to guide you…

Let´s start with LCA.

You have probably heard of LCA before – it is one of the pillars of sustainability reporting. However, we know it can be complicated figuring out how to carry it out, what data are needed and what are the advantages of doing it. We are here to help! 🐝

**Life cycle assessment (LCA)** is a tool for assessing the product’s environmental impacts across its lifespan. 🐛→🦋 The popular terms of ‘cradle to gate’, ‘cradle to grave’ and ‘cradle to cradle’ refer to how many life stages are included in an LCA. These are divided into product (A1-A3), construction (A3-A5), use (B1-7) and end of life stage (C1-4). Additionally, module D covers the resource recovery, recycling and reuse potential of materials, which we at Xylo Sweden feel especially passionate about. ♻️

Impacts that are measured with an LCA cover a broad range of environmental issues, such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, ozone depletion, depletion of abiotic resources etc. As such, an LCA is highly customizable and depending on its purpose, clients can tailor it to their needs.

During the LCA process, a wealth of data is carefully collected. From emissions stemming from energy production to waste generation and raw material extraction, every aspect is examined. 📊 Given the diverse nature of processes involved, LCA modelling tries to account for geographical variation in emission profiles to provide you with an accurate assessment. ⚡

And the benefits? An LCA helps you showcase the environmental performance of your product, identify opportunities for product improvements and it is the basis for many environmental labels and declarations.
